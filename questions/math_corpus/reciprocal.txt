= Reciprocal =
The reciprocal of a non- zero number  $ r $  (usually a real number or rational number , but also a complex number or any non-zero element of a field ) is its multiplicative  inverse .  The reciprocal is usually denoted  $ r^{-1} $  or  $ \frac 1r $  .  $ q $  and  $ r $  are multiplicative inverses of each other if and only if  $ r \cdot q = q \cdot r = 1 $  .
