= Polyhedron =
A polyhedron is a three-dimensional surface composed of at least four flat faces which encloses a region of space . These faces intersect in edges and vertices . Polyhedra are 3-D analogues of polygons . They can be thought of as sets of ordered triples.

== Classification ==

=== Concavity ===
Polyhedra can be  convex or  concave . 
=== Number of sides ===

=== Regular polyhedra ===
They have congruent faces, angles, and edges. Only regular tetrahedra, hexahedra ( cubes ), octahedra, dodecahedra, and icosahedra exist. (In addition, a sphere could be thought of a polyhedron with an infinite number of faces.) 
== Common polyhedra ==
The polyhedra most commonly encountered include: etc. Prisms and pyramids can be polyhedra. 
== Surface area ==
The surface area of a polyhedron is the sum of the areas of its sides. 
== Volume ==
The volume of a certain polyhedron is defined as  $ (B)h $  , where B is the area of the base of the polyhedron and h is the height to this base. 
== Angles ==
