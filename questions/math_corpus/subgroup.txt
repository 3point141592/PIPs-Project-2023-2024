This article is a stub.  Help us out by  .  A subgroup is a group contained in another.  Specifically, let  $ H $  and  $ G $  be groups.  We say that  $ H $  is a subgroup of  $ G $  if the elements of  $ H $  constitute a subset of the set of elements  of  $ G $  and the group law on  $ H $  agrees with group law on  $ G $  where both are defined.  We may denote this by  $ H \subseteq G $  or  $ H \le G $  . We say that  $ H $  is a proper subgroup of  $ G $  if  $ H \neq G $  .

In the additive group  $ \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} $  , shown below, \[\begin{array}{c|cccc} &0&1&2&3 \\\hline 0&0&1&2&3 \\ 1&1&2&3&0 \\ 2&2&3&0&1 \\ 3&3&0&1&2 \end{array}\] there are three subgroupsÂ :  the group itself,  $ \{ 0 \} $  , and the group  $ 2 \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} = \{0, 2\} $  , shown below.  This last subgroup is isomorphic to the additive group  $ \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} $  . \[\begin{array}{c|cc} & 0& 2 \\\hline 0&0&2 \\ 2&2&0 \end{array}\]  Every group is the largest subgroup of itself.  The set consisting of the identity element of a group is the smallest subgroup of that group. In a group  $ G $  , the intersection of a family of subgroups of  $ G $  is a subgroup of  $ G $  .  Thus for any collection  $ X $  of elements of  $ G $  , there exists a smallest subgroup containing these elements.  This is called the subgroup generated by   $ X $  . In the additive group  $ \mathbb{Z} $  , all subgroups are of the form  $ n \mathbb{Z} $  for some integer  $ n $  .  In particular, for  $ n=1 $  we have the integers themselves and for  $ n=0 $  we have  $ \{0\} $  .
