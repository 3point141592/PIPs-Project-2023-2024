= Tau =
Tau , denoted  $ \tau $  , is most commonly used as 2  $ \pi $  or 2 pi . Tau is the number of radians in a circle. For a convincing proof that  $ \tau $  is a better circle constant than  $ \pi $  , see The Tau Manifesto by Michael Hartl. This following section will summarize one main point of the Tau Manifesto. 
== Why  Is Better Than  ==
Have you ever been in geometry class and been asked to graph sine waves with their ridiculous extra factor of 2 in the x-axis? Have you ever thought radian angle measure was hopelessly tainted with the superfluous and yet unavoidable factor of 2 (There are  $ \pi $  radians in a full revolution)?  $ \tau $  resolves that. One  $ \tau $  is one revolution. Simple as that. While you have to remember that  $ \frac{\pi}{8} $  radians is NOT   $ \frac{1}{8} $  of a revolution, but is equal to  $ \frac{1}{16} $  of a revolution because of that idiosyncratic factor of 2,  $ \frac{\tau}{8} $  radians is just  $ \frac{1}{8} $  of a revolution. Likewise,  $ \frac{\tau}{3} $  radians is just  $ \frac{1}{3} $  of a revolution,  $ 9001\tau $  radians is just 9001 revolutions,  $ 123456789\tau $  radians is just 123456789 revolutions, and  $ x\tau $  radians is  $ x $  revolutions for any real  $ x $  . Some may argue that  $ \pi r^2 $  is simpler than  $ \frac{1}{2}\tau r^2 $  , but as noted in the Tau Manifesto , many quadratic forms in physics contain a factor of  $ \frac{1}{2} $  which is unavoidable.
