= Trivial Inequality =
The trivial inequality is an inequality that states that the square of any real number is nonnegative. Its name comes from its simplicity and straightforwardness. 
== Contents ==

== Statement ==
For all real numbers   $ x $  ,  $ x^2 \ge 0 $  . 
== Proof ==
We can have either  $ x=0 $  ,  $ x>0 $  , or  $ x<0 $  . If  $ x=0 $  , then  $ x^2 = 0^2 \ge 0 $  . If  $ x>0 $  , then  $ x^2 = (x)(x) > 0 $  by the closure of the set of positive numbers under multiplication. Finally, if  $ x<0 $  , then  $ x^2 = (-x)(-x) > 0, $  again by the closure of the set of positive numbers under multiplication. Therefore,  $ x^2 \ge 0 $  for all real  $ x $  , as claimed. 
== Applications ==
The trivial inequality is one of the most commonly used theorems in mathematics. It is very well-known and does not require proof. One application is maximizing and minimizing quadratic functions. It gives an easy proof of the two-variable case of the  Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality: Suppose that  $ x $  and  $ y $  are nonnegative reals. By the trivial inequality, we have  $ (x-y)^2 \geq 0 $  , or  $ x^2-2xy+y^2 \geq 0 $  . Adding  $ 4xy $  to both sides, we get  $ x^2+2xy+y^2 = (x+y)^2 \geq 4xy $  . Since both sides of the inequality are nonnegative, it is equivalent to  $ x+y \ge 2\sqrt{xy} $  , and thus we have \[\frac{x+y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy},\] as desired. Another application will be to minimize/maximize quadratics. For example, \[ax^2+bx+c = a(x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{b^2}{4a^2})+c-\frac{b^2}{4a} = a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}.\]  Then, we use trivial inequality to get  $ ax^2+bx+c\ge c-\frac{b^2}{4a} $  if  $ a $  is positive and  $ ax^2+bx+c\le c-\frac{b^2}{4a} $  if  $ a $  is negative.
