= Rational approximation of famous numbers =
Rational approximation is the application of Dirichlet's theorem which shows that, for each irrational number  $ x\in\mathbb R $  , the inequality  $ \left|x-\frac pq\right|<\frac 1{q^2} $  has infinitely many solutions. On the other hand, sometimes it is useful to know that  $ x $  cannot be approximated by rationals too well, or, more precisely, that  $ x $  is not a Liouvillian number , i.e., that for some power  $ M<+\infty $  , the inequality   $ \left|x-\frac pq\right|\ge \frac 1{q^M} $  holds for all sufficiently large denominators  $ q $  .

== Theorem ==
Suppose that there exist  $ 0<\beta<\gamma<1 $  ,  $ 1<Q<+\infty $  and a sequence of pairs of integers  $ (P_n,Q_n) $  such that for all sufficiently large  $ n $  , we have  $ |Q_n|\le Q^n $  and  $ \beta^n< \left|P_n-Q_n x\right|<\gamma^n $  . Then, for every  $ M>\frac{\log(Q/\beta)}{\log(1/\gamma)} $  , the inequality  $ \left|x-\frac pq\right|<\frac 1{q^M} $  has only finitely many solutions. The exact formulation of the main theorem in this article is fitted to the Beukers proof of the non-Liouvillian character of  $ \pi $  , but the general spirit of all such theorems is the same: roughly speaking, they tell you that in order to show that  $ x $  cannot be approximated by rationals too well, one needs to find plenty of small, but not too small, linear combinations of  $ x $  and  $ 1 $  with not too large integer coefficients. 
=== Proof ===
Choose the least  $ n $  such that  $ \gamma^n\le 2q $  . Note that for such choice of  $ n $  , we have  $ \gamma^n> \frac {\gamma}{2q} $  . Also note that  $ Q_n\ne 0 $  (otherwise  $ |P_n| $  would be an integer strictly between  $ 0 $  and  $ 1 $  ). Now, there are two possible cases: Case 1:   $ P_n-Q_n\frac pq=0 $  . 
Then  $ \left|x-\frac pq\right|=\left|x-\frac {P_n}{Q_n}\right|>\frac{\beta^n}{|Q_n|}>(\beta/Q)^n =(\gamma^n)^{\frac{\log(Q/\beta)}{\log(1/\gamma)}}> \left(\frac\gamma{2q}\right)^{\frac{\log(Q/\beta)}{\log(1/\gamma)}}>\frac 1{q^M} $   if  $ q $  is large enough. Case 2:   $ P_n-Q_n\frac pq\ne 0 $  . Then  $ \frac 1q\le\left|P_n-Q_n\frac pq\right|\le \left|P_n-Q_n x\right|+|Q_n|\cdot\left|x-\frac pq\right|\le \frac 1{2q}+Q^n\left|x-\frac pq\right| $   Hence, in this case,  $ \left|x-\frac pq\right|\ge \frac 1{2q}Q^{-n}\ge \frac \gamma{2q}Q^{-n}=\frac \gamma{2q}(\gamma^n)^{\frac{\log Q}{\log(1/\gamma)}}\ge \left(\frac\gamma{2q}\right)^{1+\frac{\log(Q}{\log(1/\gamma)}}>\frac 1{q^M} $   if  $ q $  is large enough. (recall that  $ \beta<\gamma $  , so  $ 1+\frac{\log Q}{\log(1/\gamma)} =\frac{\log(Q/\gamma)}{\log(1/\gamma)}<\frac{\log(Q/\beta)}{\log(1/\gamma)} $  ). 
== Magic Polynomial ==
Before proceeding to the applications of the main theorem, let us introduce one very useful polynomial that often appears in proofs of irrationality. It is the polynomial  $ P(x)\frac 1{n!}\left(\frac d{dx}\right)^n [x^n(1-x)^n] $   Its coefficients can be easily computed using the binomial theorem :  $ P(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k{n+k\choose n}{n\choose k}x^k. $   The important points are that all the coefficients are integer and
the sum of their absolute values does not exceed  $ \max_{0\le k\le n}{n+k\choose n}\sum_{0\le k\le n}{n\choose  k}\le {2n\choose n}2^n\le 8^n $  . Another useful remark is that the first  $ n-1 $  derivatives of  $ x^n(1-x)^n $  vanish at  $ 0 $  and  $ 1 $  , which makes the integration by parts extremely convenient:  $ \int_0^1 F(x)P(x)\,dx=(-1)^n\frac 1{n!}\int_0^1 F^{(n)}(x) x^n(1-x)^n\,dx. $   
== Example ==
This section will prove that the number  $ \ln 2 $  is not Liouvillian . It can be read right after its parent article rational approximation of famous numbers . The proof of the non-Liouvillian character of  $ \ln 2 $  is much easier than that for  $ \pi $  , but somewhat more difficult than that for  $ e $  . 
=== A Useful Integral ===
Everyone knows an integral representation for  $ \ln 2 $  . It comes right from the definition of the natural logarithm :  $ \ln 2=\int_0^1\frac {1}{1+x}\,dx $  . Let us look at what will happen if we replace  $ 1 $  in the numerator by some polynomial  $ P(x) $  of degree  $ n $  with integer coefficients. Since  $ P(x)-P(-1)=(1+x)R(x) $  where  $ R(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^k $  is some polynomial of degree  $ n-1 $  with integer coefficients, we see that  $ \int_0^1\frac{P(x)}{1+x}\,dx=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac {c_k}{k+1}+P(-1)\ln 2. $   Let now  $ D_n $  be the least common multiple of the numbers  $ 1,2,\dots, n $  . Then  $ D_n\int_0^1\frac{P(x)}{1+x}\,dx=P_n-Q_n\ln 2 $   with some integer  $ P_n $  and  $ Q_n=-D_nP(-1) $  .
It remains to choose a polynomial  $ P(x) $  that makes the integral small. 
=== Polynomial  ===
We shall just take our "magic polynomial"  $ P(x):=\frac{1}{n!}\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^n[x^n(1-x)^n] $  (see the parent article for its properties). 
=== Estimates of the Integral ===
Integrating by parts  $ n $  times, we see that  $ \int_0^1\frac{P(x)}{1+x}\,dx= (-1)^n\int_0^1\left[\frac{x(1-x)}{1+x}\right]^n\,\frac{dx}{1+x} $  .
Since  $ \max_{0<x<1}x(1-x)=\frac 14 $  and since it is attained only at the point  $ x=\frac 12 $  where  $ 1+x>1 $  , we can conclude that  $ \Gamma=\max_{0<x<1}\frac{x(1-x)}{1+x}<\frac 14 $  . The absolute value of our integral does not exceed  $ \Gamma^n $  for all  $ n $  . To estimate it from below, just notice that the integrand is at least  $ \frac 12\left(\frac 2 {15}\right)^n $  for  $ \frac 1 3 < x< \frac 2 3 $  , so the absolute value of our integral is at least  $ \frac 16\left(\frac 2 {15}\right)^n>\left(\frac 1 8\right)^n $  for large  $ n $  . 
=== Estimate of  ===
Since the largest possible power of a given prime  $ p\le n $  that can divide one of the numbers  $ 1,2,\dots,n $  is  $ \left\lfloor\frac{\log n}{\log p}\right\rfloor $  where  $ \lfloor\cdot\rfloor $  is the floor function, we have  $ D_n=\prod_{p\mathrm{\ prime,}\,p\le n}p^{\left\lfloor\frac{\log n}{\log p}\right\rfloor}\le \left(\prod_{p\mathrm{\ prime,}\,p\le \sqrt n}n\right)\cdot\left( \prod_{p\mathrm{\ prime,}\,\sqrt n<p\le n}p\right)\le n^{\sqrt n}\cdot\prod_{p\mathrm{\ prime,}\,p\le n}p\le n^{\sqrt n}\cdot 4^n $   according to Chebyshev's estimate . Also, we clearly have  $ D_n\ge 1 $  . Thus the absolute value of the product  $ D_n\int_0^1\frac{P(x)}{1+x}\,dx $  is between  $ (1/8)^n $  and  $ (4\Gamma)^n\cdot n^{\sqrt n} $  for large  $ n $  . Note that  $ n^{\sqrt n} $  grows slower than any geometric progression, so the upper bound can be replaced by  $ \gamma^n $  with any  $ \gamma\in(4\Gamma, 1) $  . In order to apply the main theorem from the parent article , it remains to show that  $ Q_n $  do not grow too fast. 
=== Estimate of  ===
We already saw that  $ D_n $  grows not much faster than  $ 4^n $  . As to  $ |P(-1)| $  , it does not exceed the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of  $ P(x) $  , which is not greater than  $ 8^n $  . Thus  $ |Q_n| $  grow not much faster than  $ 32^n $  , and we are done.
