== Background ==
Let  $ A $  be a partially ordered set . We say that  $ A $  is inductively ordered if every  totally ordered  subset   $ T $  of  $ A $  has an upper bound, i.e., an element  $ a \in A $  such that for all  $ x\in T $  ,  $ x \le a $  .  We say that  $ A $  is strictly inductively ordered if every totally ordered subset  $ T $  of  $ A $  has a least upper bound , i.e., an upper bound  $ a $  so that if  $ b $  is an upper bound of  $ T $  , then  $ a \le b $  . An element  $ m \in A $  is  maximal if the relation  $ a \ge m $  implies  $ a=m $  .  (Note that a set may have several maximal elements.) We say a function   $ fÂ : A \to A $  is increasing if  $ x \le f(x) $  for all  $ x\in A $  . 
== Statement ==
Every inductively ordered set  $ A $  has a maximal element. 
== Proof (using the Axiom of Choice) ==
We first prove some intermediate results, viz., Bourbaki's Theorem (also known as the Bourbaki-Witt theorem). Let  $ A $  be a strictly inductively ordered set, and let  $ f: A \to A $  be an increasing function.  Pick some  $ a \in A $  .  Let  $ A' $  be the set of elements  $ x \in A $  such that  $ a \le A $  .  Evidently,  $ A' $  is stricty inductively ordered, for if  $ T $  is a totally ordered subset of  $ A' $  , then it has a least upper bound in  $ A $  , which is evidently greater than  $ a $  , so this least upper bound is an element of  $ A' $  .  We say that a subset  $ B \subseteq A' $  is admissable if it satisfies these conditions: Let  $ M $  be the intersection of all admissable subsets of  $ A' $  .  We note that  $ M $  is not empty, as  $ A' $  is an admissable subset of itself, and all admissable sets contain  $ a $  .  Then  $ M $  is the least admissable set, under order by inclusion. We say that an element  $ c \in M $  is an extreme point if  $ x\in M $  ,  $ x < c $  together imply  $ f(x) \le c $  .  For an extreme point  $ c $  denote by  $ M_c $  the set of  $ x\in M $  such that  $ x \le c $  or  $ f(c) \le x $  . 
=== Lemma 1. ===
For each extreme point  $ c $  ,  $ M_c = M $  . Proof. It suffices to show that  $ M_c $  is an admissable set.  Evidently,  $ a\le c $  , so  $ a \in M_c $  .  Now, let  $ x $  be an element of  $ M_c $  .  If  $ x = c $  , then evidently,  $ f(c) \le f(x) $  , so  $ f(x) \in M_c $  .  If  $ x < c $  , then since  $ c $  is an extreme point,  $ f(x)\le c $  , so  $ f(x) \in M_c $  .  On the other hand, if  $ f(c) \le x $  , then  $ f(c) \le x \le f(x) $  , so  $ f(x) \in M_c $  .  Therefore  $ f(M_c) \subseteq M_c $  . Let  $ T $  be a totally ordered subset of  $ M_c $  .  Then  $ T $  has a least upper bound  $ s\in A' $  .  Since  $ M $  is admissable,  $ s\in M $  .  Now, if  $ s \le c $  , then evidently  $ s\in M_c $  .  On the other hand, if  $ s\ge c $  , then either  $ f(c) \le s $  , or every element of  $ T $  is less than or equal to  $ c $  , so  $ s \le c $  .  Hence the least upper bound of every totally ordered subset  $ T $  of  $ M_c $  is an element of  $ M_c $  , so  $ M_c $  is admissable.  Therefore  $ M \subseteq M_c $  ; since we know  $ M_c \subseteq M $  , it follows that  $ M= M_c $  .  
=== Lemma 2. ===
Every element of  $ M $  is an extreme point. Proof. Let  $ E $  be the set of extreme points of  $ M $  .  As before, it suffices to show that  $ E $  is an admissable set.  Evidently,  $ a $  is an extreme point of  $ M $  , as no element of  $ M $  is less than  $ a $  , so every element less than  $ a $  is also less than or equal to  $ f(a) $  .  Now, suppose  $ c $  is an extreme point of  $ M $  .  Then for any  $ x\in M $  , if  $ x < f(c) $  , then by Lemma 1,  $ x\le c $  .  If  $ x=c $  , then  $ f(x) = f(c) $  , so  $ f(x) \le f(c) $  ; if  $ x<c $  , then since  $ c $  is an extreme point,  $ f(x) \le c \le f(c) $  .  Therefore  $ f(c) $  is an extreme point, so  $ f(E) \subseteq E $  . Now, let  $ T $  be a totally ordered set of extreme points.  Consider the least upper bound  $ s $  of  $ T $  in  $ M $  .  If  $ x $  is an element of  $ M $  strictly less than  $ s $  , then  $ x $  must be strictly less than some element  $ c \in T $  .  But  $ c $  is an extreme point, so  $ f(x) \le c \le s $  .  Therefore  $ s $  is an extreme point, i.e., an element of  $ E $  .  It follows that  $ E $  is an admissable set, so as before,  $ E=M $  .  
=== Theorem 3 (Bourbaki). ===
For any strictly inductively ordered set  $ A $  and any increasing function  $ f: A \to A $  , there exists an element  $ x_0 $  of  $ A $  such that  $ x_0 = f(x_0) $  . Proof. Choose an arbitrary  $ a\in A $  , and define  $ A' $  as before.  Let  $ M $  be the least admissable subset of  $ A' $  , as before.  By Lemmata 2 and 1, for all elements  $ a,b \in M $  , either  $ a \le b $  , or  $ b \le f(b) \le a $  .  Therefore  $ M $  is totally ordered under the ordering induced by  $ A $  .  Then  $ M $  has a least upper bound  $ x_0 $  which is an element of  $ M $  .  We note that  $ f(x_0) \in M $  , so  $ f(x_0) \le x_0 $  , and since  $ f $  is increasing,  $ x_0 \le f(x_0) $  .  Hence  $ x_0 = f(x_0) $  , as desired.  Note that thus far, we have not used the Axiom of Choice.  In the next corollary, however, we will use the Axiom of Choice. 
=== Corollary 4. ===
Let  $ A $  be a strictly inductively ordered set.  Then  $ A $  has a maximal element. Proof. Suppose the contrary.  Then by the Axiom of Choice, for each  $ x \in A $  , we may define  $ f(x) $  to be an element strictly greater than  $ x $  .  Then  $ f $  is an increasing function, but for no  $ x \in A $  does  $ x = f(x) $  , which contradicts the Bourbaki-Witt Theorem.  
=== Corollary 5 (Zorn's Lemma). ===
Let  $ A $  be an inductively ordered set.  Then  $ A $  has a maximal element. Proof. Let  $ T $  be the family of totally ordered subsets of  $ A $  . We claim that under the order relation  $ \subseteq $  ,  $ T $  is a strictly inductively ordered set.  Indeed, if  $ \{ X_i \}_{i\in I} $  is a totally ordered subset of  $ T $  , then \[Z = \bigcup_{i\in I} X_i\] is evidently the least upper bound of the  $ X_i $  , and if  $ a,b \in Z $  , then for some  $ i,j \in I $  ,  $ a \in X_i $  and  $ b \in X_j $  ; one of  $ X_i $  and  $ X_j $  is a subset of the other, by assumption, so  $ a $  and  $ b $  are comparable.  It follows that  $ Z $  is totally ordered, i.e.,  $ Z \in T $  . Now, by Corollary 4, there exists a maximal element  $ P $  of  $ T $  .  This set  $ P $  is totally ordered, so it has an upper bound  $ x_0 $  in  $ A $  .  Then  $ P \cup \{x_0\} $  is a totally ordered set, so by the maximality of  $ P $  ,  $ x_0 \in P $  .  Now, if  $ y\ge x_0 $  , then  $ P \cup \{y\} $  is a totally ordered set, so  $ y \in P $  and  $ y\le x_0 $  , so  $ y=x_0 $  .  Therefore  $ x_0 $  is a maximal element, as desired.
