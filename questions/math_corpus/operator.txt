= Operators (Python) =
In computer programming, operators are built-in functions similar to mathematical operations .  This article focuses primarily on numerical operators and relational operators.  For other types and some special cases, see String operations , Boolean operations and Sequence operations .

== Numerical Operators ==
For the operators that take more than one argument, if either of the arguments are floats the output will always be a float (rather than an integer) unless otherwise noted. 
== Relational Operators ==
Relational operators, also simply called comparisons, are operators that return booleans . Notes: 
== Precedence Rules ==
Python understands and adheres to the standard precedence rules.  In particular, operators will be applied in the following order: Operators of the same precedence level are applied from left to right.  For more clarity or if you need to override these rules you can enclose subexpressions in parentheses.
