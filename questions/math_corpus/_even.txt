= Even integer =
An even integer is any integer which is a multiple of  $ 2. $  The even integers are  $ \ldots, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, \ldots $  ; specifically, note that  $ 0 $  is even. Every even integer can be written in the form  $ 2k $  for some unique integer  $ k $  . The sum and difference of any two integers with the same parity is even.
The product of any two even integers is not only even but is also divisible by  $ 4. $  The sum of an even integer and an odd integer is odd. Since every even integer is divisible by  $ 2, $    $ 2 $  is the only prime even integer. The number of even integers are in the interval  $ (0, x) $  is equal to  $ \left\lfloor\frac {|x|}{2}\right\rfloor+1 $   This article is a stub.  Help us out by  .
