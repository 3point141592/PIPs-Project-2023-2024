Let  $ M $  be a monoid operating on a set   $ S $  , and let  $ A $  and  $ B $  be subsets of  $ S $  .  Then the transporter of  $ A $  to  $ B $  is the set of elements  $ a\in M $  for which  $ a(A) \subseteq B $  .  The strict transporter of  $ A $  to  $ B $  is the set of  $ a\in M $  for which  $ a(A) = B $  .  The transporter of  $ A $  to itself is called the stabilizer of  $ A $  . This article is a stub.
