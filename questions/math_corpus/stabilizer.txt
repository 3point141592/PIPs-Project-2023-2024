A stabilizer is a part of a monoid (or group ) acting on a set. Specifically, let  $ M $  be a monoid operating on a set  $ S $  , and let  $ A $  be a subset of  $ S $  .  The stabilizer of  $ A $  , sometimes denoted  $ \text{stab}(A) $  , is the set of elements of  $ a $  of  $ M $  for which  $ a(A) \subseteq  A $  ; the strict stabilizer' is the set of  $ a \in M $  for which  $ a(A)=A $  .  In other words, the stabilizer of  $ A $  is the transporter of  $ A $  to itself. By abuse of language, for an element  $ x\in S $  , the stabilizer of  $ \{x\} $  is called the stabilizer of  $ x $  . The stabilizer of any set  $ A $  is evidently a sub-monoid of  $ M $  , as is the strict stabilizer.  Also, if  $ a $  is an invertible element of  $ M $  and a member of the strict stabilizer of  $ A $  , then  $ a^{-1} $  is also an element of the strict stabilizer of  $ a $  , for the restriction of the function  $ a : S \to S $  to  $ A $  is a bijection from  $ A $  to itself. It follows that if  $ M $  is a group   $ G $  , then the strict stabilizer of  $ A $  is a subgroup of  $ G $  , since every element of  $ G $  is a bijection on  $ S $  , but the stabilizer need not be.  For example, let  $ G=S= \mathbb{Z} $  , with  $ g(s) = g+s $  , and let  $ A=\mathbb{Z}_{>0} $  .  Then the stabilizer of  $ A $  is the set of nonnegative integers , which is evidently not a group.  On the other hand, the strict stabilizer of  $ A $  is the set  $ \{0\} $  , the trivial group.  On the other hand, if  $ A $  is finite , then the strict stabilizer and the stabilizer are one and the same, since  $ a : S \to S $  is bijective, for all  $ a\in G $  . Proposition. Let  $ G $  be a group acting on a set  $ S $  .  Then for all  $ x\in S $  and all  $ a \in G $  ,  $ \text{stab}(ax) = a\, \text{stab}(x) a^{-1} $  . Proof. Note that for any  $ g \in \text{stab}(x) $  ,  $ (aga^{-1})ax = agx = ax. $  It follows that \[a\, \text{stab}(x) a^{-1} \subseteq \text{stab}(ax) .\] By simultaneously replacing  $ x $  with  $ ax $  and  $ a $  with  $ a^{-1} $  , we have \[\text{stab}(ax) \subseteq  a\, \text{stab}(x) a^{-1} ,\] whence the desired result.  $ \blacksquare $   In other words, the stabilizer of  $ ax $  is the image of the stabilizer of  $ x $  under the inner automorphism   $ \text{Int}(a) $  .
