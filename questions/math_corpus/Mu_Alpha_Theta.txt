= Mu Alpha Theta =
Mu Alpha Theta is a national honor society in the United States for high school and two year college students.  Mu Alpha Theta chapters host numerous mathematics competitions and each year a national Mu Alpha Theta convention is held during the summer that includes a large competition.

== The Competition ==
Mu Alpha Theta competitions can be divided up into regionals, invitationals, states, and national competitions. There is no need to progress through the levels- you simply register and you can participate. There are many different tests with different topic themes. High School students are often organized into three groups- Mu, Alpha and Theta. Theta is the lowest level, Alpha is higher and Mu is the highest. 
== The Test ==

=== Individual ===
The test is a multiple choice test with 4 choices and an extra choice called NOTA, which means None Of The Above. Test topics usually follow school curriculum subjects; however they are far more advanced. The main groups in the regional and invitational levels are: You may only take one type of test a year for every competition, depending on how many competitions your region has a year. 
At the states and nationals, there are many more different topic tests ranging from trigonometry to analytic geometry to complex numbers.
(Full list coming soon.)
The tests are often made by other students.
They generally have 30 questions. However, at nationals and state, some tests have 40 questions. There is also a one hour time limit except for History of Math which has a 30 minute time limit.
The scoring system usually is as follows: However at Nationals the scoring system is as follows: 
=== Team Rounds ===
In team rounds, teams of 4 people work fast to answer a problem in 4 minutes. However, the faster a team turns in an answer, the more points recieved. This round is NOT multiple choice.
Questions, just as in the individual round, often follow a certain subject.
Questions usually follow the certain rubic: A=<insert some kind of math problem here> B=<Insert some kind of math problem here> C=<Insert some kind of math problem here> D=<Insert some kind of math problem here> Find AB-CD. However, this is not always the case.

== Science Fair ==
At many regional and state science and engineering fairs, Mu Alpha Theta gives away prizes to high school students. These are prizes for investigating a modern mathematical problem.
