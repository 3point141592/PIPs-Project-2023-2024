= Limit =
The limit is the key concept that separates calculus from elementary mathematics such as arithmetic , elementary algebra or Euclidean geometry . It also arises and plays an important role in the more general settings of topology , analysis , and other fields of mathematics. It took several centuries to articulate the definition of a limit and to make it rigorous.

== Intuitive Meaning ==
Many people new to calculus have difficulty understanding the  formal definition of a limit . Thus we begin with an informal explanation: a limit is the value to which a function grows close when its argument is near (but not at!) a particular value. For example, \[\lim_{x\to 2}x^2=4\] because whenever  $ x $  is close to 2, the function  $ f(x)=x^2 $  grows close to 4. In this case, the limit of the function happens to equal the value of the function (  $ \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = f(c) $  ). This is because the function we chose was continuous at  $ c $  . However, not all functions have this property. For example, consider the function  $ f(x) $  over the reals defined as follows: \[f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } x\neq 0,\\ 1 & \text{if } x=0. \end{cases}\] Although the value of the function  $ f(x) $  at  $ x = 0 $  is  $ 1 $  , the limit  $ \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} f(x) $  is, in fact, zero. Intuitively, this is because the limit describes the behavior of the function near (but not at!) the value in question: when  $ x $  is very close (but not equal!) to zero,  $ f(x) $  will always be close to (in fact equal to) zero. 
== Definition ==
Let  $ A $  and  $ B $  be metric spaces , let  $ A' $  be a subspace of  $ A $  , and, let  $ f $  be a function from  $ A' $  to  $ B $  . Let  $ c $  be a limit point of  $ A' $  . (This means that in the metric space  $ A $  , there are elements of  $ A' $  arbitrarily close to  $ c $  .) Let  $ L $  be an element of  $ B $  . We say \[\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L,\] (that is, the limit of  $ f(x) $  as  $ x $  goes to  $ c $  equals  $ L $  ) if for every positive real  $ \epsilon $  there exists a positive  real  $ \delta $  for which \[0 < d_A(x,c) < \delta\] implies \[d_B(f(x),L) < \epsilon\] for all  $ x \in A' $  . Here  $ d_A $  and  $ d_B $  are the distance functions of  $ A $  and  $ B $  , respectively. In terms of our informal definition,  $ \epsilon $  is a measure of "how close" we want  $ f(x) $  to be to its limit value. Then the formal definition says that no matter how close we want to be (for any   $ \epsilon > 0 $  ), we can make our variable close enough (within a distance  $ \delta $  , for some  $ \delta $  ) to  $ c $  to achieve our goal. In analysis and calculus, usually  $ A $  and  $ B $  are both either the set of  reals   $ \mathbb{R} $  or complex numbers   $ \mathbb{C} $  . In this case, the distance functions  $ d_A(a,b) $  and  $ d_B(a,b) $  are both simply  $ |a-b| $  . We then obtain the following definition commonly found in calculus textbooks: \[\lim_{x\to c} f(x) =L\]  \[0 < |x-c| < \delta \quad \text{implies} \quad |f(x) - L| < \epsilon .\]  However, most theorems on real limits apply to limits in general, with identical proofs. 
== Existence of Limits ==
Limits do not always exist. For example  $ \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{x} $  does not exist, since, in fact, there exists no  $ \epsilon $  for which there exists  $ \delta $  satisfying the definition's conditions, since  $ \left|\frac{1}{x}\right| $  grows arbitrarily large as  $ x $  approaches 0. However, it is possible for  $ \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) $  not to exist even when  $ f $  is defined at  $ c $  . For example, consider the Dirichlet function,  $ D(x) $  , defined to be 0 when  $ x $  is irrational, and 1 when  $ x $  is rational. Here,  $ \lim_{x\rightarrow c}D(x) $  does not exist for any value of  $ c $  . Alternatively, limits can exist where a function is not defined, as for the function  $ f(x) $  defined to be 1, but only for nonzero reals. Here,  $ \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f(x)=1 $  , since for  $ x $  arbitrarily close to 0,  $ f(x)=1 $  . 
== Uniqueness ==
The notation  $ \lim_{x\to c}f(x) = L $  would only be justifiable if the limit  $ L $  were unique. Fortunately, it is always the case that if a limit exists, it is unique. Indeed, suppose that  $ L' $  is also  $ \lim_{x\to c}f(x) $  , and that  $ L \neq L' $  . Since  $ d_B(L,L') >0 $  , we can pick a positive real  $ \epsilon < d_B(L,L')/2 $  . But for any  $ y \in L $  , \[d_B(L,y) + d_B(L',y) \ge d_B(L,L'),\] so no  $ y $  can simultaneously satisfy the conditions \begin{align*} d_B(L,y) &< \epsilon < \frac{d_B(L,L')}{2} \\ d_B(L',y) &< \epsilon < \frac{d_B(L,L')}{2} , \end{align*} a contradiction. Therefore limits are unique, as we wanted. 
== Left and Right Hand Limits ==
In this section, we consider limits of functions whose domain and range are both subsets of the set of reals. Left and right hand limits are the limits taken as a point is approached from the left and from the right, respectively. The left hand limit is denoted as  $ \lim_{x\to c^{-}} f(x) $  , and the right hand limit is denoted as  $ \lim_{x\to c^{+}} f(x) $  . If the left hand and right hand limits at a certain point differ, than the limit does not exist at that point. For example, if we consider the step function (the greatest integer function)  $ f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor $  , we have  $ \lim_{x\to 0^{+}} \lfloor x \rfloor = 0 $  , while  $ \lim_{x\to 0^{-}} \lfloor x \rfloor = -1 $  . A limit exists if the left and right hand side limits exist, and are equal. 
== Sequential Criterion ==
Let  $ A\subset\mathbb{R} $  and let  $ c $  be a cluster point of  $ A $  . A function  $ fÂ : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $  has a limit  $ L = \lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) $  if for every sequence   $ \left\langle x_n \right\rangle $  that converges to  $ c $  ,  $ \left\langle f(x_n) \right\rangle $  converges to  $ L $  .
