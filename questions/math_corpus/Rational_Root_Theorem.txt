= Rational root theorem =
In algebra , the rational root theorem states that given an integer polynomial   $ P(x) $  with leading coefficient  $ a_n $  and constant term  $ a_0 $  , if  $ P(x) $  has a rational root  $ r = p/q $  in lowest terms, then  $ p|a_0 $  and  $ q|a_n $  . This theorem is most often used to guess the roots of polynomials. It sees widespread usage in introductory and intermediate mathematics competitions.

== Proof ==
Let  $ \frac{p}{q} $  be a rational root of  $ P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 $  , where every  $ a_r $  is an integer; we wish to show that  $ p|a_0 $  and  $ q|a_n $  . Since  $ \frac{p}{q} $  is a root of  $ P(x) $  , \[0 = a_n \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^n + a_{n-1} \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) + a_0.\] Multiplying by  $ q^n $  yields \[0 = a_n p^n + a_{n-1} p^{n-1} q + \cdots + a_1 p * q^{n-1} + a_0 q^n.\] Using modular arithmetic modulo  $ p $  , we have  $ a_0 q^n \equiv 0\pmod p $  , which implies that  $ p | a_0 q^n $  . Because we've defined  $ p $  and  $ q $  to be relatively prime,  $ \gcd(q^n, p) = 1 $  , which implies  $ p | a_0 $  by Euclid's lemma . Via similar logic in modulo  $ q $  ,  $ q|a_n $  , as required.  $ \square $   Intro to Rational Roots theorem: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wKpmfnyKeeM  
== Examples ==
Here are some problems with solutions that utilize the rational root theorem. 
=== Example 1 ===
Find all rational roots of the polynomial   $ x^4-x^3-x^2+x+57 $  .  Solution : The polynomial has leading coefficient  $ 1 $  and constant term  $ 3 \cdot 19 $  , so the rational root theorem guarantees that the only possible rational roots are  $ -57 $  ,  $ -19 $  ,  $ -3 $  ,  $ -1 $  ,  $ 1 $  ,  $ 3 $  ,  $ 19 $  , and  $ 57 $  . After testing every number, we find that none of these are roots of the polynomial; thus, the polynomial has no rational roots.  $ \square $   
=== Example 2 ===
Factor the polynomial   $ x^3-5x^2+2x+8 $  .  Solution : After testing the divisors of 8, we find that it has roots  $ -1 $  ,  $ 2 $  , and  $ 4 $  . Then because it has leading coefficient  $ 1 $  , the factor theorem tells us that it has the factorization  $ (x-4)(x-2)(x+1), x={-1, 2, 4} $  .  $ \square $   
=== Example 3 ===
Using the rational root theorem, prove that   $ \sqrt{2} $   is irrational.  Solution : The polynomial  $ x^2 - 2 $  has roots  $ \pm \sqrt{2} $  . The rational root theorem guarantees that the only possible rational roots of this polynomial are  $ -2, -1, 1 $  , and  $ 2 $  . Testing these, we find that none are roots of the polynomial, and so it has no rational roots. Then because  $ \sqrt{2} $  is a root of the polynomial, it cannot be a rational number.  $ \square $
