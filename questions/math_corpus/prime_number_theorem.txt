= Prime Number Theorem =
The Prime Number Theorem (PNT) is one of the most
celebrated results in analytic number theory .  Indeed, it is
possibly the most famous major result in all of number theory, with
the exception of Fermat's Last Theorem .  (Fortunately, the proof
is easier, though still non-trivial!)  It gives an
asymptotic formula for the distribution of the prime numbers ;
specifically, it states that the functions  $ \pi(x) $  and  $ x/\log x $  are asymptotically equivalent , where  $ \pi(x) $  is the number
of primes less than or equal to  $ x $  .  In other words, it states
that \[\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\pi(x) \log x}{x} = 1 .\]

=== First Conjectures ===
Gauss conjectured the theorem as early as 1793, in terms of the logarithmic integral , which is asymptotically equivalent
to  $ x / \log x $  .  Legendre conjectured in 1798 that for some
constants  $ A $  and  $ B $  , \[\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{A \log x - B} .\] In 1808 he refined his conjecture to \[\pi(x) = \frac{x}{\log x - A(x)} ,\] with  $ A(x) $  tending to some constant number around 1.08366.
(In fact,  $ A(x) $  does not seem to tend to this value, but its
actual asymptotic behavior is apparently unknown.) 
=== Early Results ===
In 1850, Chebyshev proved that for sufficiently large  $ x $  ,
there existed reals  $ A, B $  such that \[A < \frac{\pi(x) \log x}{x} < B ,\] and he was able to give \[A = \frac{\log 2}{2} + \frac{\log 3}{3} + \frac{\log 5}{5} - \frac{\log 30}{30} \approx 0.921292 ,\] and  $ B = \frac{6A}{5} \approx 1.10555 $  . In 1859, Riemann established the relation between the distribution
of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the distribution
of the prime numbers; in this same paper, he posed the Riemann Hypothesis , namely that the zeta function's nontrivial
zeros all lie on the line  $ \Re z = 1/2 $  .  To this day,
it remains unsolved. In 1892, Sylvester was able to improve Chebyshev's bounds
with  $ A = .956 $  ,  $ B=1.045 $  .  However, his methods did not
seem likely to yield better bounds. 
=== Proof and Refinement ===
Finally, in 1896, Jacques Hadamard and Charles-Jean de la
ValÎée Poussin independently proved that the zeta function
has no zeros on the line  $ \Re s = 1 $  , and from this deduced
the prime number theorem.  Their proofs were somewhat long; Hadamard's paper was some 20 pages long.  De la Vallée Poussin's proof that  $ \zeta(1+ri) $  has no zeros was about 25 pages long; Hadamard's
proof was essentially the modern version, though de la Vallée
Poussin and Mertens later simplified it.  The proof that this
statement implied the prime number theorem remained long for
some time. In 1948, Alte Selberg and Paul Erdős simultaneously
found "elementary" proofs of the prime number theorem.  Unfortunately,
these proofs are still much longer than the shortest proofs
of today that use complex analysis. Finally, in 1980, D.J. Newman found a  theorem with a short proof
that provided a much simpler link between the zeta function
and the prime number theorem.  This is essentially the proof
given here. 
== Outline ==
The major results are the fact that the Riemann zeta function
has no zeros on the line  $ \Re s = 1 $  , and the Tauberian theorem
due to Newman.  The rest of the theorem's proof is comparatively
straightforward, though still non-trivial.  We do not prove
those results in this article, but instead refer to their
proofs  here and Newman's Tauberian Theorem . 
== Proof ==
We use the Riemann zeta function , which is defined as \[\zeta(s) = \sum_{n\ge 1} \frac{1}{n^s} =  \prod_{p \text{ prime}} ( 1 - p^{-s} )^{-1} .\] This function has an analytic continuation to the entire
complex plane except  $ s= 1 $  , where it has a simple pole of
residue 1. We define \[\phi(s) = \sum_{p} \frac{\log p}{p^s} .\] As discussed  here ,
the function  $ \phi(s) $  extends to the set  $ \Re s > 1/2 $  by the
relation \[\phi(s) = - \frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} - \sum_p \frac{\log p}{ p^s (p^s- 1)} .\]  Thus we may define the function \[g(z) = \frac{\phi(z+1)}{z+1} - \frac{1}{z} .\] Since  $ \zeta(s) $   has no zeros on the line   $ \Re s =1 $  ,
the function  $ g(z) $  is holomorphic on the set  $ \Re z \ge 0 $  . 
=== The Bounded Integral ===
Theorem 1. The integral \[\int\limits_1^{\infty} \frac{\vartheta(x) - x}{x^2} dx\] converges to  $ g(0) $  . Proof. We rely on a  tauberian theorem due to Newman . Let  $ x = e^t $  .  We note that \[\int\limits_1^{e^T} \frac{\vartheta(x) -x}{x^2} dx =  \int\limits_0^T [\vartheta(e^t)e^{-t} - 1 ]dt.\]  Now, for  $ \Re s > 1 $  , \begin{align*} \int\limits_0^\infty [ \vartheta(e^t)e^{-t(s+1)}- e^{-st} ] dt &= \int\limits_1^\infty \left[ \frac{\vartheta(x)}{x^{s+2}} - \frac{1}{x^{s+1}} \right] dx \\ &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \int\limits_{p_k}^{p_{k+1}} \frac{\vartheta(x)} {x^{s+2}} - \frac{1}{s} \\ &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \vartheta(p_k) \int\limits_{p_k}^{p_{k+1}} \frac{dx}{x^{s+2}} - \frac{1}{s}\\ &= \frac{1}{s+1}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \vartheta(p_k) (1/p_k^{s+1} - 1/p_{k+1}^{s+1}) - \frac{1}{s} . \end{align*} Now, by the Abel Summation Technique , we have \begin{align*} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \vartheta(p_k)(1/p_k^{s+1} - 1/p_{k+1}^{s+1}) &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \sum_{i=0}^k \log p_i (1/p_k^{s+1} - 1/p_{k+1}^{s+1}) \\ &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\log p_k}{p_k^{s+1}} \\ &= \phi(s+1). \end{align*} Thus for  $ \Re s >1 $  (for the integral), \[\int_0^\infty [\vartheta(e^t)e^{-t} -1 ]e^{-st} dt = \frac{\phi(s+1)}{s+1} - \frac{1}{s} = g(s).\] Now, by a  theorem due to Chebyshev ,
the function  $ \vartheta(x)/x - 1 $  is bounded above (by 1).
The function  $ f(t) = \vartheta(e^t)e^{-t} -1 $  thus satisfies
the conditions of Newman's Tauberian Theorem , and the
result follows.  $ \blacksquare $   
=== End of Proof ===
The rest of the theorem is more simple. Theorem 2. The functions  $ \vartheta(x) $  and  $ x $  are
asymptotically equivalent. Proof. Suppose that  $ \lambda \ge 1 $  is a number
such that there are infinitely many  $ x $  for which  $ \vartheta(x) \ge \lambda x $  .  Then for all such  $ x $  , \begin{align*} \int\limits_x^{\lambda{x}} \frac{\vartheta(t) -t}{t^2} dt&\ge \int\limits_x^{\lambda{x}} \frac{\lambda x - t}{t^2}dt \\ &= \lambda x \left( \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{\lambda x} \right)- \left(\log (\lambda x) - \log x\right) \\ &= \lambda -1 - \log \lambda . \end{align*} Now,  $ d(x-1 - \log x)/dx = 1 - 1/x $  ; it follows that \[\lambda - 1 - \log \lambda \ge 0 ,\] with equality exactly when  $ \lambda =1 $  .  But by theorem 1,
this quantity must equal 0 in absolute value, so  $ \lambda = 1 $  . Analogously, suppose that  $ \lambda \le 1 $  is a number
such that there are infinitely many  $ x $  for which  $ \vartheta(x) \le \lambda x $  . 	Then for any such  $ x $  , \begin{align*} \int\limits_{\lambda x}^x \frac{\vartheta{x} - t}{t^2}dt \le \int\limits_{\lambda x}^x \frac{\lambda x -t}{t^2}dt &= \lambda x \left( \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{\lambda x} \right) - ( \log x - \log(\lambda x) ) \\ &= 1 - \lambda + \log \lambda \le 0. \end{align*} Again, by theorem 1, this quantity must equal zero in absolute
value; it follows that  $ \lambda = 1 $  . If follows that  $ \limsup \vartheta(x)/x = \liminf \vartheta(x)/x =1 $  .  $ \blacksquare $   Theorem 3 (Prime Number Theorem). The functions  $ \pi(x)\log x $  and  $ x $  are asymptotically equivalent. Proof. We note that \[\vartheta(x) = \sum_{p \le x} \log p \le \sum_{p\le x} \log x = \pi(x) \log x .\] Since  $ \vartheta(x) \sim x $  , it follows that \[\liminf \frac{\pi(x) \log x}{x} \ge 1.\]  On the other hand, for any  $ \epsilon > 0 $  , \begin{align*} \vartheta(x) = \sum_{p\le x} \log p \ge \sum_{x^{1-\epsilon} \le p \le x} \log p &\ge \sum_{x^{1-\epsilon}\le p \le x} (1-\epsilon) \log x \\ &\ge (1-\epsilon) \log x ( \pi(x) - x^{1-\epsilon} ) , \end{align*} so \[\pi(x) \log x \le \frac{\vartheta(x)}{1-\epsilon} + x^{1-\epsilon}\log x = x \left( \frac{\vartheta(x)}{(1-\epsilon)x} + \frac{\log x}{x^\epsilon} \right) .\] Again, since  $ \vartheta(x) \sim x $  , it follows that for
any  $ \epsilon > 0 $  , \[\limsup \frac{\pi(x) \log x}{x} \le \limsup \left(\frac{1}{1-\epsilon} + \frac{\log x}{x^\epsilon} \right) = \frac{1}{1 -\epsilon} .\] Thus \[\limsup \frac{\pi(x)\log x}{x} \le 1 .\] Therefore \[\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\pi(x)\log x}{x} = 1. \qquad  \blacksquare\]
