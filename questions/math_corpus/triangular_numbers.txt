= Triangular number =
The triangular numbers are the numbers  $ T_n $  which are the sum of the first  $ n $   natural numbers from  $ 1 $  to  $ n $  . 
== Definition ==
The  $ n^{th} $  triangular number is the sum of all natural numbers from one to n.
That is, the  $ n^{th} $  triangle number is  $ 1 +2+3 + 4............. +(n-1)+(n) $  . For example, the first few triangular numbers can be calculated by adding 
1, 1+2, 1+2+3, ... etc. 
giving the first few triangular numbers to be  $ 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21 $  . A rather simple recursive definition can be found by noting that  $ T_{n} = 1 + 2 + \ldots + (n-1) + n = (1 + 2 + \ldots + n-1) + n = T_{n-1} + n $  . They are called triangular because you can make a triangle out of dots, and the number of dots will be a triangular number: [asy] int draw_triangle(pair start, int n) {   real rowStart = start.x;   for (int row=1; row<=n; ++row)   {     for (real j=rowStart; j<(rowStart+row); ++j)     {       draw((j, start.y - row), linewidth(3));     }     rowStart -= 0.5;   }   return 0; }  for (int n=1; n<5; ++n) {   real value= n*(n+1)/2;   draw_triangle((value+5,n),n);   label( (string) value, (value+5, -2)); } [/asy]  
== Formula ==
Using the sum of an arithmetic series formula, a formula can be calculated for  $ T_n $  : The formula for finding the  $ n^{th} $  triangular number can be written as  $ \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2} $  . It can also be expressed as the sum of the  $ n^{th} $  row in Pascal's Triangle and all the rows above it. Keep in mind that the triangle starts at Row 0.   This article is a stub.
