= Multiplicative function =
A multiplicative function   $ f $  is a function such that  $ f(x\cdot y) = f(x) \cdot f(y) $  for all  $ x, y $  .  That is,  $ f $   commutes with multiplication.  Multiplicative functions arise most commonly in the field of number theory , where an alternate definition is often used: a function from the positive integers to the complex numbers is said to be multiplicative if  $ f(m \cdot n) = f(m) \cdot f(n) $  for all   $ m, n $  . The function  $ f $  defined on the real numbers by  $ f(x) = x^2 $  is a simple example of a multiplicative function. For a function  $ f : S \to T $  to be multiplicative, the domain   $ S $  and range   $ T $  must be sets with multiplication.  Then  $ f(x\cdot y) = f(x) \cdot f(y) $  means that  $ f $  preserves the multiplicative structure.  One prominent class of functions with this property are homomorphisms of groups (where the group operation is multiplication). 
== Multiplicative functions in number theory ==
Multiplicative functions are of special importance in the field of analytic number theory .  In this context, one works with multiplicative functions  $ f : \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to \mathbb{C} $  . In this case, one sometimes also defines weak multiplicative functions : a function  $ f: \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to \mathbb{C} $  is weak multiplicative if and only if  $ f(mn) = f(m)f(n) $  for all pairs of  positive integers   $ (m, n) $  .  If actually  $ f(mn) = f(m)f(n) $  for all positive integers  $ m, n $  , we say that  $ f $  is strongly multiplicative (but this notion is of less central importance). Examples of multiplicative functions in elementary number theory include the identity map , the divisor function   $ d(n) $  that gives the number of divisors of the integer  $ n $  , the sum of divisors function   $ \sigma(n) $  that gives the sum of divisors of the integer  $ n $  (and its generalization  $ \sigma_k(n) = \sum_{d|n}d^k $  ), Euler's totient function   $ \phi(n) $  , and the Mobius function   $ \mu(n) $  . Let  $ f(n) $  be multiplicative in the number theoretic sense ("weak multiplicative"). Then the function  $ g(n) $  defined by \[g(n) = \sum_{d|n} f(d)\] is also multiplicative.  In this situation, the Mobius inversion formula allows us to write  $ f(n) $  in terms of  $ g(n) $  .  This article is a stub.  Help us out by  .  Something appears to not have loaded correctly.
