= Incircle =
An incircle of a convex  polygon is a circle which is inside the figure and  tangent to each side.  Every triangle and regular polygon has a unique incircle, but in general polygons with 4 or more sides (such as non-  square  rectangles ) do not have an incircle. A quadrilateral that does have an incircle is called a Tangential Quadrilateral . For a triangle, the center of the incircle is the Incenter , where the incircle is the largest circle that can be inscribed in the polygon. The Incenter can be constructed by drawing the intersection of angle bisectors.
