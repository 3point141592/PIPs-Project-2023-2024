= String theory =
String theory, or Superstring theory is a Theory of Everything that states that the most fundamental particle in the universe is a superstring, which vibrates through 10 dimensions. It also states that all subatomic particles are composed of the same "stuff"; an up quark and an electron are both composed of superstring "stuff," rather than one being composed of up quark "stuff" and the other electron "stuff."
