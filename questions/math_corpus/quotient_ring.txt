A quotient ring is a quotient set of the elements of a ring with an induced ring structure. 
== Characterization of Equivalence Relations Compatible with Ring Structure ==
Theorem. Let  $ R $  be an equivalence relation on the underlying set of a pseudo-ring   $ A $  .  Then  $ R(x,y) $  is compatible with addition and left (resp. right) multiplication if and only if  $ R(x,y) $  is equivalent to a statement of the form "  $ x-y \in \mathfrak{a} $  ", for some left (resp. right) ideal   $ \mathfrak{a} $  of  $ A $  . Proof. We prove the case for left ideals; the other case follows from passing to the opposite ring. Suppose  $ R $  is an equivalence relation on  $ A $  compatible with addition and left multiplication.  Let  $ \mathfrak{a} $  be the equivalence class of 0.  Then  $ R(x,y) $  is evidently equivalent to the statement "  $ x-y\in \mathfrak{a} $  , so it remains to show that  $ \mathfrak{a} $  is a left ideal of  $ A $  . By definition,  $ 0\in \mathfrak{a} $  , and for any  $ x,y\in \mathfrak{a} $  , \[x+ y \equiv 0+0 \equiv 0 \pmod{R},\] so  $ x+y \in \mathfrak{a} $  ; that is,  $ \mathfrak{a} $  is closed under addition.  Finally, for any  $ x\in A $  and  $ y\in \mathfrak{a} $  , \[xy \equiv x \cdot 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{R} ,\] so  $ A\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{a} $  .  Therefore  $ \mathfrak{a} $  is a left ideal of  $ A $  . Conversely, let  $ \mathfrak{a} $  be any left ideal of  $ A $  .  We wish to show that "  $ x-y \in \mathfrak{a} $  " is an equivalence relation compatible addition and left multiplication in  $ A $  .  Evidently, if  $ x\equiv y \pmod{\mathfrak{a}} $  and  $ y\equiv z \pmod{\mathfrak{a}} $  , then \[x-z = (x-y)+(y-z) \in \mathfrak{a},\] so  $ x\equiv z\pmod{\mathfrak{a}} $  .  Also,  $ x-x = 0 $  is an element of  $ \mathfrak{a} $  , and if  $ (x-y) $  is, then so is  $ -(x-y) = y-x $  .  This shows that equivalence modulo  $ \mathfrak{a} $  is an equivalence relation. Now we show that equivalence modulo  $ \mathfrak{a} $  is compatible with addition and left multiplication.  Indeed, suppose that  $ x-y \in \mathfrak{a} $  ; then for any  $ a\in A $  , \[(a+x)- (a+y) = x-y \in \mathfrak{a},\] so  $ a+x \equiv a+y \pmod{\mathfrak{a}} $  .  Finally, for any  $ a\in A $  , \[a(x-y) \in \mathfrak{a},\] since  $ \mathfrak{a} $  is a left ideal of  $ A $  .  $ \blacksquare $   Corollary. Let  $ A $  be a ring, and  $ R(x,y) $  an equivalence relation on the elements of  $ A $  .  Then  $ R $  is compatible with the ring structure of  $ A $  if and only if it is of the form "  $ x-y \in \mathfrak{a} $  ", for some two-sided ideal  $ \mathfrak{a} $  of  $ A $  .
