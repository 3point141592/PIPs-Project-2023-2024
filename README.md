## Welcome!  
  
These are all the projects I’ve made in my 2023-2024 PIPs. For each one,
there is a README like this one that explains the project.  
  
They come in the following format:  
  
COMPLETE: True/False value that specifies whether the project is
complete  
DESCRIPTION: short text that describes the project  
INTERACTIVE: True/False, explains if the project is interactive  
USAGE: command to put in terminal that runs it
URL: The link to the instructions or tutorial for the project.  
  
If time for checking is limited, here is the ranked list, in ascending
order, from least important to most important:  
  
1. Crossword (it’s not finished)   
2. Knights (it’s not interactive)  
3. Degrees 
4. Pagerank  
5. Heredity  
6. Tic Tac Toe  
7. minesweeper  
8. questions
9. SuperResolution
