Temperature is the average kinetic energy of the particles within an object or region. In other words, the faster the particles move, the hotter the object or region is and if particles move slowly, then the object or region will be cold. The SI unit for temperature is the Kelvin in which its zero is exact zero and particles do not move at all; other commonly used scaled are Celsius and Fahrenheit . To convert a given temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the following equation: \[F=\frac{9}{5}C+32\] where  $ F $  denotes the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and  $ C $  is the the temperature in degrees Celsius. To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, use the equation:  $ K=C+273.15 $   This article is a stub.  Help us out by  .  Something appears to not have loaded correctly. Click to refresh .
