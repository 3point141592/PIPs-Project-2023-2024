= Matrix =
A matrix over a field  $ F $  is a function from  $ A\times B $  to  $ F $  , where  $ A $  and  $ B $  are the sets  $ A=\{1,2,\ldots,m\} $  and  $ B=\{1,2,\ldots,n\} $  .
A matrix is usually represented as a rectangular array of scalars from the field , such that each column belongs to the vector space   $ F^m $  , where  $ m $  is the number of rows. If a matrix  $ A $  has  $ m $  rows and  $ n $  columns, its order is said to be  $ m \times n $  , and it is written as  $ A_{m \times n} $  . The element in the  $ i^{th} $  row and  $ j^{th} $  column of  $ A $  is written as  $ (A)_{ij} $  . It is more often written as  $ a_{ij} $  , in which case  $ A $  can be written as  $ [a_{ij}] $  .

== Determinant ==
If  $ A_{m\times n} $  is a matrix over  $ F $  with  $ m=n $  , a Determinant assigns  $ A_{m\times n} $  to a member of  $ F $  and is denoted by  $ |A| $  or  $ \begin{vmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \ldots & a_{nn}\end{vmatrix} $   It is defined recursively. where  $ A'_{cd} $  is the matrix  $ A $  with the  $ c^{th} $  row and  $ d^{th} $  column removed. 
== Transposes ==
Let  $ A $  be  $ [a_{ij}] $  . Then  $ [a_{ji}] $  is said to be the transpose of  $ A $  , written as  $ A^T $  or simply  $ A' $  . If A is over the complex field, replacing each element of  $ A^T $  by its complex conjugate gives us the conjugate transpose  $ A^* $  of  $ A $  . In other words,  $ A^*=[\bar {a_{ji}}] $    $ A $  is said to be symmetric if and only if  $ A=A^T $  .  $ A $  is said to be hermitian if and only if  $ A=A^* $  .  $ A $  is said to be skew symmetric if and only if  $ A=-A^T $  .  $ A $  is said to be skew hermitian if and only if  $ A=-A^* $  . 
== Matrix Product ==
Let  $ A $  be a matrix of order  $ m_1 \times m_2 $  and  $ B $  a matrix of order  $ n_1 \times n_2 $  . Then the product  $ AB $  exists if and only if  $ m_2=n_1 $  and in that case we define the product  $ C=AB $  as the matrix of order  $ m_1 \times n_2 $  for which \[(C)_{ij}=\sum ^{n_1} _{k=1} (A)_{ik} (B)_{kj}\] for all  $ i $  and  $ j $  such that  $ 1\le i\le m_1 $  and  $ 1\le j\le n_2 $  . 
== Vector spaces associated with a matrix ==
As already stated before, the columns of  $ A $  form a subset of  $ F^m $  . The subspace of  $ F^m $  generated by these columns is said to be the column space of  $ A $  , written as  $ C(A) $  . Similarly, the transposes of the rows form a subset of the vector space  $ F^n $  . The subspace of  $ F^n $  generated by these is known as the row space of  $ A $  , written as  $ R(A) $  .  $ y \in C(A) $  implies  $ \exists x $  such that  $ y_{m \times 1} = A_{m \times n} x_{n \times 1} $   Similarly,  $ y \in C(A) $  implies  $ \exists x $  such that  $ y_{n \times 1} = A^T_{n \times m} x_{m \times 1} $   The set  $ \{x:A_{m \times n}x_{n \times 1} = \phi\} $  forms a subspace of  $ F^n $  , known as the null space  $ N(A) $  of  $ A $  . 
== Rank and nullity ==
The dimension of  $ C(A) $  is known as the column rank of  $ A $  . The dimension of  $ R(A) $  is known as the row rank of  $ A $  . These two ranks are found to be equal, and the common value is known as the rank  $ r(A) $  of  $ A $  . The dimension of  $ N(A) $  is known as the nullity  $ \eta (A) $  of A. If  $ A $  is a square matrix of order  $ n \times n $  , then  $ r(A) + \eta (A) = n $  . Something appears to not have loaded correctly. Click to refresh .
