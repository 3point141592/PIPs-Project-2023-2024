= Congruent (geometry) =
Congruency is a property of multiple geometric figures. 
== Contents ==

== Intuitive Definition ==
Two  geometric  figures are congruent if one of them can be turned and/or flipped and placed exactly on top of the other, with all parts lining up perfectly with no parts on either figure left over.  In plain language, two objects are congruent if they have the same size and shape. 
== Technical Definition ==
Two  geometric objects are congruent if one can be transformed into the other by an isometry , such as a translation , rotation , reflection or some combination thereof. 
== Axioms ==
\[\overline{AB}\cong\overline{A'B'}.\] Every segment is congruent to itself; that is, we always have \[\overline{AB}\cong\overline{AB}.\]  \[\angle (h,k) \cong \angle (h',k')\] Every angle is congruent to itself; that is, \[\angle (h,k) \cong \angle (h,k)\] or \[\angle (h,k) \cong \angle (k,h)\]   $ \angle (h, k) \equiv \angle (h'',k'') $  , then  $ \angle (h',k') \cong \angle (h'',k'') $  . \[\overline{AB}\cong\overline{A'B'}, \: \overline{AC}\cong\overline{A'C'}, \: \angle BAC\cong\angle B'A'C'\] hold, then the congruences \[\angle ABC\cong\angle A'B'C' \:\mbox{and}\; \angle ACB\cong\angle A'C'B'\] also hold.

== Triangle Congruence ==

=== SSS Congruence ===
If the three sides of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding sides of of another triangle, then congruence between the two triangles is established. We start with  $ \triangle ABC $  and  $ \triangle XYZ $  shown in the diagram below where  $ \overline{AB}\cong\overline{XY} $  ,  $ \overline{BC}\cong\overline{YZ} $  , and  $ \overline{AC}\cong\overline{XZ} $  supposing that  $ \triangle ABC\cong\triangle XYZ $  . [asy] size(500); pair A,B,C; A=(0,0); B=(3,2); C=(5,0); draw(A--B--C--cycle); label(" $ A $ ",A,SW); label(" $ B $ ",B,N); label(" $ C $ ",C,SE); add(pathticks(A--B)); add(pathticks(B--C,2)); add(pathticks(A--C,3)); pair X,Y,Z; X=(10,0); Y=(13,2); Z=(15,0); draw(X--Y--Z--cycle); label(" $ X $ ",X,SW); label(" $ Y $ ",Y,N); label(" $ Z $ ",Z,SE); add(pathticks(X--Y)); add(pathticks(Y--Z,2)); add(pathticks(X--Z,3)); [/asy] We construct point  $ B' $  on the opposite side of  $ \overleftrightarrow{AC} $  from  $ B $  such that  $ \triangle AB'C\cong\triangle XYZ $  . Since  $ B' $  is on the opposite side of  $ \overleftrightarrow{AC} $  from  $ B $  , segment  $ \overline{BB'} $  must intersect the line  $ \overleftrightarrow{AC} $  at some point  $ D $  . Updating our diagram gives us [asy] size(500); pair A,B,C,D,E; A=(0,0); B=(3,2); C=(5,0); D=(3,-2); E=(3,0); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(A--D--C--cycle); draw(anglemark(D,A,C)); draw(B--D); label(" $ A $ ",A,SW); label(" $ B $ ",B,N); label(" $ C $ ",C,SE); label (" $ B' $ ",D,S); label(" $ D $ ",E,NE); add(pathticks(A--B)); add(pathticks(B--C,2)); add(pathticks(A--C,3)); add(pathticks(A--D)); pair X,Y,Z; X=(10,0); Y=(13,2); Z=(15,0); draw(X--Y--Z--cycle); draw(anglemark(Z,X,Y)); label(" $ X $ ",X,SW); label(" $ Y $ ",Y,N); label(" $ Z $ ",Z,SE); add(pathticks(X--Y)); add(pathticks(Y--Z,2)); add(pathticks(X--Z,3)); [/asy] We now have several cases depending on the location of point  $ D $  relative to  $ A $  and  $ C $  .  $ D $   is strictly between   $ A $   and   $ C $  , as shown in the diagram above. Therefore,  $ D $  must be in the interiors of both  $ \angle ABC $  and  $ \angle AB'C $  , but since  $ \triangle ABC\cong\triangle XYZ $  and  $ \triangle AB'C\cong\triangle XYZ $  , we have  $ \overline{AB}\cong\overline{XY}\cong\overline{AB'} $  and  $ \overline{BC}\cong\overline{YZ}\cong\overline{B'C} $  . From this, we find that  $ \triangle BAB' $  and  $ \triangle BCB' $  are isosceles, and therefore  $ \angle ABB'\cong\angle AB'B $  and  $ \angle CBB'\cong\angle CB'B $  , so  $ \angle ABC=\angle ABB'+\angle CBB'=\angle AB'B+\angle CB'B=\angle AB'C $  . We have  $ \triangle ABC\cong\triangle AB'C $  by SAS congruence.  $ A $   is strictly between   $ C $   and   $ D $  . Without loss of generality, we can derive  $ \triangle ABC\cong\triangle AB'C $  from the fact that  $ C $  is strictly between  $ A $  and  $ D $  . This article is a stub.  Help us out by  .  
=== SAS Congruence ===
The SAS Congruence theorem is derived from the sixth axiom of congruence. In short, the sixth axiom states that when given two triangles, if two corresponding side congruences hold and the angle between the two sides is equal on both triangles, then the other two angles of the triangle are equal.

=== AAS Congruence ===
Since the third angle of a triangle is always the difference of  $ 180^\circ $  and the other two angles, two triangles with two pairs of congruent angles would give another pair of congruent angles. When we have a pair of congruent sides and two pairs of congruent angles adjacent to the side, it is ASA congruence. However, if we're given a pair of congruent angles opposite from the side that is congruent and a pair of congruent angles adjacent to that side, everything is congruent. Therefore, AAS congruence can be proven with ASA congruence. This article is a stub.  Help us out by  .  
=== HL Congruence ===
If both the hypotenuse and leg of one right triangle are congruent to that of another, the two triangles are congruent. Consider right  $ \triangle ABC $  and right  $ \triangle XYZ $  shown in the diagram below. We are given that  $ AB=XY $  and  $ AC=XZ $  . [asy] size(500); pair A,B,C; A=(0,0); B=(9/5,12/5); C=(5,0); draw(A--B--C--cycle); label(" $ A $ ",A,SW); label(" $ B $ ",B,N); label(" $ C $ ",C,SE); draw(rightanglemark(A,B,C)); pair X,Y,Z; X=(10,0); Y=(59/5,12/5); Z=(15,0); draw(X--Y--Z--cycle); label(" $ X $ ",X,SW); label(" $ Y $ ",Y,N); label(" $ Z $ ",Z,SE); draw(rightanglemark(X,Y,Z)); [/asy] Since  $ \angle B=90^\circ $  , the Pythagorean theorem gives us  $ AB^2+BC^2=AC^2 $  . Similarly, using the Pythagorean theorem on  $ \triangle XYZ $  gives us  $ XY^2+YZ^2=XZ^2 $  . However, since  $ AB=XY $  and  $ AC=XZ $  , substitution in the second equation gives  $ AB^2+YZ^2=AC^2 $  . Subtracting this from our first equation plus a little manipiulation gives us  $ AC^2=YZ^2 $  . Therefore, since all lengths are positive, taking the square root of both sides gives  $ AC=YZ $  , so, by the SSS congruence theorem, we have  $ \triangle ABC\cong\triangle XYZ $  . Since the congruent angle given is not between the two equivalent sides, this may be seen as SSA congruence, which is not necessarily correct. However, this form of SSA congruence holds true for right triangles. 
=== LL Congruence ===
LL Congruence is the basically the same as SAS congruence since we are given a leg, a right angle, and the other leg.
