= Root-mean-square =
The root-mean-square or quadratic mean of a collection of real numbers   $ x_1,\dots , x_n $  is defined to be  $ \sqrt{\frac{x^2_1+x^2_2+\dots+x^2_n}{n}} $  .  This is the second power mean of the  $ x_i $  . It is so-named because it is the square root of the mean of the squares of the  $ x_i $  . It is also part of the well-known Root-Mean Square-Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean-Harmonic mean Inequality
