== Kinetic Energy ==
Simply put, kinetic energy is the amount of movement energy an object possesses. It is given by the formula K=1/2*mass*velocity^2. Notable theorems include the work energy theorem W=change in kinetic energy and the Conservation of energy theorem, Ki+Ui=Kf+Uf.  See Potential Energy. Something appears to not have loaded correctly.
