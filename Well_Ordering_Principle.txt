= Well Ordering Principle =
The Well Ordering Principle states that every nonempty subset of the positive integers  $ \mathbb{Z}^{+} $  contains a smallest element.  While this theorem is mostly brushed off as common sense, there is a bit of formalism required to actually prove it sufficiently.  We will do this here. Definition : A subset  $ A $  of the real numbers is said to be inductive if it contains the number  $ 1 $  , and if for every  $ x\in A $  , the number  $ x+1\in A $  as well.  Let  $ \mathcal{A} $  be the collection of all the inductive subsets of  $ \mathbb{R} $  .  Then the positive integers denoted  $ \mathbb{Z}^{+} $  are defined by the equation Using this definition, we can rephrase the principle of mathematical induction as follows: if  $ A $  is an inductive set of the positive integers, then  $ A=\mathbb{Z}^{+} $  .  We can now proceed with the proof.  Proof : We first show that for any  $ n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+} $  , every nonempty subset of  $ \{1,2,\ldots, n\} $  has a smallest element.  Let  $ A $  be the set of all positive integers  $ n $  where this statement holds.  We see  $ A $  contains  $ 1 $  , since if  $ n=1 $  then the only subset of  $ \{1,2,\ldots, n\} $  is  $ \{1\} $  itself.  Then, supposing  $ A $  contains  $ n $  we show that it must contain  $ n+1 $  .  Let  $ C $  be a nonempty subset of  $ \{1,2,\ldots, n+1\} $  .  If  $ C=\{n+1\} $  then  $ n+1 $  is its smallest element.  Otherwise, consider  $ C\cap \{1,2,\ldots,n\} $  , which is nonempty.  Because  $ n\in A $  , this set has a smallest element, which will be the smallest element of  $ C $  also.  This means that  $ A $  is inductive and  $ A=\mathbb{Z}^{+} $  , so the statement is true for all  $ n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+} $  .  
Now suppose  $ D\in \mathbb{Z}^{+} $  is nonempty.  By choosing some  $ n\in D $  , the set  $ A\cap\{1,2\ldots, n\} $  is also nonempty which means that  $ A $  has a smallest element  $ k $  .  This means that  $ k $  is the smallest element of  $ D $  too, which completes the proof  $ \square $   Something appears to not have loaded correctly. Click to refresh .
