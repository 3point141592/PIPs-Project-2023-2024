= Meromorphic =
This article is a stub.  Help us out by  .  Let  $ D\subseteq\mathbb{C} $  be a connected  open set in the complex plane . A function  $ f $  on  $ D $  is said to be meromorphic if there are functions  $ g $  and  $ h $  which are holomorphic on  $ D $  ,  $ h $  has isolated   zeros and  $ f $  can be written as  $ f(z)=\frac{g(z)}{h(z)} $  wherever  $ h(z)\neq 0 $  .
