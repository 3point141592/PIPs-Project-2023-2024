= Ball-and-urn =
The ball-and-urn technique, also known as stars-and-bars , sticks-and-stones , or dots-and-dividers , is a commonly used technique in combinatorics . It is used to solve problems of the form: how many ways can one distribute  $ k $  indistinguishable objects into  $ n $  distinguishable bins? We can imagine this as finding the number of ways to drop  $ k $  balls into  $ n $  urns, or equivalently to arrange  $ k $  balls and  $ n-1 $  dividers. For example, \[****||\] \[***|*|\] \[*|**|*\] \[...\] represent the ways to put  $ 4 $  objects in  $ 3 $  bins. The number of ways to do such is  $ {4+3-1 \choose 3-1} = {6 \choose 2} = 15 $  . More generally, the number of ways to put  $ k $  objects into  $ n $  bins is  $ {n+k-1 \choose k-1} $  or  $ \dbinom{n+k-1}n $  . The number of ways to put  $ k $  objects into  $ n $  bins, where each bin must have at least 1 object in it, is  $ {k-1 \choose n-1} $  .

 Main article:   Let's say that we want to put  $ N $  objects in  $ n $  bins, but there must be at least  $ k $  objects in each bin. Without the restriction, we can set the following equation up:  $ a_1+a_2+a_3+\dots+a_n=N $  . We know that each  $ a_i $  (the bins) must have at least  $ k $  objects in them, so we can subtract  $ nk $  from  $ N $  , since that's how many objects are left. This means that there are  $ \binom{N-nk+n-1}{n-1} $  ways to distribute the objects. Well, what if we can have at most  $ k $  objects in each bin? We can use the following formula to find this: \[\binom{N+n-1}{n-1} - \sum_{m=1}^{\left\lfloor\frac{N}{k+1}\right\rfloor}(-1)^{m+1} \binom{n}{m} \binom{N-m(k+1)+n-1}{n-1} = \sum_{m=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{N}{k+1}\right\rfloor}(-1)^{m} \binom{n}{m} \binom{N-m(k+1)+n-1}{n-1}\] This can be derived using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion . 
== Reasoning 1 ==
Arranging  $ k $  *'s and  $ n-1 $  |'s is the same as saying there are  $ k+n-1 $  positions: \[\underbrace{\_~~ \_~~ \_~~ \_~~ \_~~ \_~~}_{k+n-1}\] and you want to fill  $ k $  of them with *'s and the rest of them with |'s. Thus you are choosing  $ k $  positions out of  $ n+k-1 $  total positions, resulting in a total of  $ {n+k-1\choose n-1} $  ways. 
== Reasoning 2 ==
If you could only put one ball in each urn, then there would be  $ {n \choose k} $  possibilities; the problem is that you can repeat urns, so this does not work.  $ n $  and then you also have  $ k-1 $  urns labeled "repeat 1st", "repeat 2nd", ..., and "repeat  $ k-1 $  -th". After the balls are in urns you can imagine that any balls in the "repeat" urns are moved on top of the correct balls in the first  $ n $  urns, moving from left to right. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the non-repeating arrangements in these new urns and the repeats-allowed arrangements in the original urns. For a simple example, consider  $ 4 $  balls and  $ 5 $  urns. The one to one correspondence between several of the  possibilities and the "repeated urns" version is shown. Since there are 4 balls, these examples will have three possible "repeat" urns. For simplicity, I am listing the numbers of the urns with balls in them, so "1,1,2,4" means  $ 2 $  balls in urn  $ 1, 1 $  in urn  $ 2, $  and  $ 1 $  in urn  $ 4. $  The same is true for the "repeat" urns options but I use the notation  $ r_1 $  etc. Since the re-framed version of the problem has  $ n+k-1 $  urns, and  $ k $  balls that can each only go in one urn, the number of possible scenarios is simply  $ {n+k-1  \choose k}. $  Note: Due to the principle that  $ {a \choose b}={a \choose a-b} $  , we can say that  $ {n+k-1 \choose k}={n+k-1 \choose n-1} $  .
